After initialising we are able to set branch master
Staging area helps you in grouping all files of the same logical commit
Branches help in working on a new task without disturbing the old code and we can come back to old code if we do not like the changes
Diagrams helps in visualising the commits and we can avoid detached head state, hence not loosing any commit

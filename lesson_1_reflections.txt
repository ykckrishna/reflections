We can clearly see the difference between the two files.
You can easliy access any version of the file, which help you
in tracking the changes.
Manual Commit:
Pros; You can logically differentiate when to commit.
Cons: Takes more time in thinking what to commit and what not to commit.
Change in one file might not allow the whole system to work 
git log- to see all the commits
git diff- to see the difference between the commits
